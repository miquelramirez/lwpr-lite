# lwpr-lite

Locally Weighted Projection Regression (LWPR) fork from http://wcms.inf.ed.ac.uk/ipab/slmc/research/software-lwpr

This repository contains the "core" features from the LWPR implementation in
the link above, namely:

 - Storage and reading of XML models
 - Binary input and output
 - C++ interface
 - Eigen 3.2 C++ interface

so there's no support for MATLAB and OCTAVE. The Python bindings in this repository
have been ported to Python 3.5+.
